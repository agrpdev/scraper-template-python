# Scraper Template

## Introduction

This is a Python scraper template designed to facilitate web scraping tasks using the asyncio library for asynchronous operations. It provides a structured approach to handle different types of work items such as crawling, scraping, streaming, and health checks. The template also integrates with an API for controlling scraper behavior and reporting progress.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies** : Make sure to install the required dependencies using pip. You can install them by running:

```Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configuration** : Set up your environment variables, especially the API key required for accessing the external API. You can use a `.env` file to store these variables.
3. **Customization** : Customize the scraper by extending the `BaseScraper` class and implementing the specific scraping logic for your use case.
4. **Running the Scraper** :

```Copy code
python scraper.py
```

## Example Usage

Example scraper can be found in scrapers/archiweb.py
